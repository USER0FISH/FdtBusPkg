# Another README for Developers

> [!NOTE]
> See [FdtBusPkg Documentation Style and Terms Definitions](StyleAndTerms.md) first.

A few notes to keep in mind when contributing:

- Keep the docs in sync with any patches and changes to [DtIo.h](../Include/Protocol/DtIo.h).
- New functionality must be checked in along with the relevant regression test (in the same commit).
- Use Tiano coding style (run edk2 uncrustify).
